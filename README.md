# Cyber Threat Hunting by Nadhem AlFardan: a technical review
The scope of this repo is to provide a technical review of each chapter (that I like) from the book **Cyber Threat Hunting** by Nadhem AlFardan, published by Manning.

Here a list of the blog that I published:
* [Chapter 3 - Your First Threat Hunting Expedition](https://lucavauda.bearblog.dev/my-first-threat-hunting-expedition/)
* [Chapter 4 - Threat Intelligence for Threat Hunting](https://lucavauda.bearblog.dev/threat-intel-4-threat-hunt/)
* [Chapter 6 - Using fundamental statistical constructs](https://lucavauda.bearblog.dev/statistical-constructs-or-how-i-learned-to-use-the-standard-deviation/)
